        NASA is constantly trying to scientifically reach new heights in order to benefit humans, and this has been seen on larger and smaller scales. NASA has answered many of our deepest questions, such as *what is really out there?*, but they have extended it into asking *how do we use that to help us?*. They used science to develop satellites, which have been used to not only give us visual images of the earth and much that surrounds it, but it also is used to monitor conditions here on earth to improve our life quality. The Mars Rover that NASA currently has is not only monitoring Mars for the sake of curiosity, but they want to know if it may contain/provide resources to help us here. They not only undergo extensive research simply to fly, but this research is linked with small businesses that even benefit our global economy. NASA uses these daily components to interact with us on many scales, but is also able to conduct activities larger than our imaginations.
