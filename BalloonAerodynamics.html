                <FONT size=5><h4> a. What is density? Give some examples. </h4></FONT>
Density is how thick or compact a substance is, and it is measured in grams per milliliter. It is found by dividing the mass of the substance by its volume, so therefore the more weight apparent in the substance, the higher its density. 
                <FONT size=5><h4> b. How can you change the density of a balloon (or your alternative neutral buoyant system)? </h4></FONT>
In my alternative neutral buoyant system, I used an Easter egg which initially had buoyancy since it was less dense than its surrounding fluid (water). Since density is measured by dividing the mass by its volume, I decided to make the egg hold a little more weight to be submerged more and to increase the force pulling it down. In order to do this, I had to add grains of rice which acted as the ballast, providing drag. At first the pressure was too high causing it to sink, and so I needed to decrease the net force. By doing this I took out some grains which gave the Easter egg some lift, and provided it with acceleration to reach the middle. I then stepped aside when I thought it had reached the middle to decrease any thrust that was left from me pulling it in and out of the water and to calm the water down. When the water was calm, I stopped touching the egg, and allowed it to remain at a state of inertia since it remained neutrally floating in the middle.
