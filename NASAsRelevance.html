        Many people are lead to believe that NASA is only about finding life on Mars, and have no practical benefits to humans. Although, NASA implements its benefits into everyday life, such as the economy. For example, businesses use NASAs technologies in manufacturing goods which benefits the economy and increases competitiveness in the market. Also, by teaming up with smaller companies, NASA increases their research development and strengthens that small company, allowing it to emerge as an economic player.</h3>

<h3> There are practical benefits in fields other than the economy that are used every day, such as medicine, technology, and safety. Safety wise, NASA invented a technology, first aimed towards their astronauts, to prevent them from getting food poisoning. This is now used by people throughout the world. Also, NASA can predict certain weather patterns allowing us to be constantly prepared for what we have coming, whether it is a hurricane or a snow storm. They have also provided us with a much safer transportation system. Regarding medicine, NASA has developed an artificial heart pump to assist people who may be having a heart attack by temporarily mimicking the heart in continuing the pumping of blood. This has saved many lives. Lastly, though NASA has obviously made tons of technological developments, my personal favorite is the GPS navigator. Connecting with NASAs satellites, this navigation system is used every day by millions without knowing its direct link to NASA. </h3>

<h3> In the future, NASAs positive affects will continue to expand through its space exploration, aeronautics research, science, and education.  The increased space exploration might eventually find us more usable resources as the earths resources may be in decline. Resources, such as water, can be monitored through NASAs aeronautics research to make sure that we have abundance supply in necessary places, to allow us to distribute to those who may be experiencing a drought. Monitoring water levels also lets us know of our status regarding global warming, and how much polar ice has melted due to this so called crisis. NASA can also determine the source of this heat, which may be current energy providers/fossil fuels, and be able to find replacement forms of energy using scientific research. This high level of science can also lead to new medical discoveries that may change more lives. And lastly, regarding education, NASA can provide the best technologies to be used in classrooms in order to enlighten the minds of millions of children. These technologies are constantly growing, as are graduation rates.
